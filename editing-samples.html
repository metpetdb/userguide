<p> <strong>Note: To edit your samples in the database, you must be logged into your account and have previously uploaded a sample.</strong></p>
<p> To edit a sample, select <strong>My Samples</strong> from the menu bar at the top of the page, then select the sample number of the sample you'd like to change. Next, select <strong>Edit Sample</strong> in the top right corner of the page, below the menu bar. This will bring you to a page similar to the single sample upload page: modify the fields you'd like to change, and then select <strong>Save Changes</strong> at the bottom.</p>
<p>Use a very similar procedure to edit subsamples or chemical analyses. First, navigate to the parent sample, then select the subsample you'd like to edit. To edit a subsample, click <strong>Edit Subsample</strong> at the top right. To edit a chemical analysis, select the parent subsample, then the chemical analysis you'd like to edit, then select <strong>Edit Chemical Analysis</strong> in the top right. When you've navigated to the appropriate edit page, make the changes you'd like to make, then select <strong>Save Changes</strong> as you would when editing a sample.</p>
