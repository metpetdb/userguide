<p> The search functionality of MetPetDB is broken up into two different sections: you can filter by qualities of samples or by qualities of subsamples. To begin searching, hover over <strong>Search</strong> in the menu bar, and select which of the two you'd like to search through.</p>
<p> Here are the features you can use when searching through <i> samples </i>:
<ol>
	<li> <i>Rock Types:</i> This is the first option you'll see when the search page loads. When you select rock types here, your search will return all samples containing <i>any</i> of these rock types. </li>
	<li> <i> Metamorphic Grade: </i> To open this search option, select <strong>Metamorphic Grade</strong> from the set of tabs below "Search Options." Similar to the Rock Types option, selecting metamorphic grades here will result in a search showing all samples which contain <i>any</i> of the specified metamorphic grades. </li>
	<li> <i> Location: </i> To open this search option, select <strong>Location</strong> from the set of tabs below "Search Options." Location contains a few different search options:
		<ol>
			<li><i>Map search</i>: This is the first option you'll see when you select Location. You can use this feature to draw polygons on the map and search for samples which were found within those coordinates. To do this, simply click on the map where you would like to mark coordinates of the polygon. You can use the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong> buttons to zoom in and out on the map. To pan, select the small hand icon in the top center of the map. Select the polygon icon to the right of it to go back to drawing polygons. Remember to <i>close your polygons</i>. You'll know it's closed if the area becomes shaded and the coordinates appear in your search summary. You can clear your polygons at any point by selecting <strong>Clear</strong> in the top right corner of the map. </li>
			<li><i>Region search:</i> To do a region search, select the <strong>Region</strong> tab to the right of the <strong>Map</strong> tab beneath the "Location" title. Here, you can specify regions, countries, or metamorphic regions you would like to restrict your results to. Specify these values by selecting values from the dropdown boxes. To find the values you'd like to select, you can either scroll through the entire list of options, or begin to type in the value you're seeking to filter the values displayed in the dropdown. To eliminate a single selection you've made, click the small <strong>x</strong> box on the right of the parameter's gray box.</li>
			<li> <strong>Important Notes </strong>:
				<ol>
					<li> If you specify values for different location attributes (i.e. regions and countries), your search will only return samples which meet <i>each</i> of these requirements. For example, a search with Regions: Adirondacks, Clear Creek Canyon; Countries: United States, Austria will show you samples which have a region of Adirondacks <u>or</u> Clear Creek <u>in addition to</u> a country of United States <u>or</u> Austria. </li>
					<li>The "Regions" and "Countries" options are both user-input. This means there may be similar or equivalent entries ("United States," "United States of America," "USA") for these sections. Your search results will only include samples which are an <i>exact match</i> for these user-input values. (You will not see a sample in a search for "United States" if its country was entered as "USA.") Be mindful of these distinctions when entering your searches. </li>
				</ol>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li> <i> Minerals: </i> To open this search option, select <strong>Minerals</strong> from the set of tabs below "Search Options." For Minerals search, you have two options: an AND search or an OR search. The OR search works like the Rock Types or Metamorphic Regions search: it will display in all samples which contain <i>any</i> of the specified minerals. The other option, AND search, shows only samples which contain <u>every specified mineral</u>.</li>
	<li> <i> Provenance: </i> To open this search option, select <strong>Provenance</strong> from the set of tabs below "Search Options." There are a few different options within provenance. Owner, Collector, Reference, and Sample Number are all entered through searchable dropdowns, while Date Range uses a calendar date selector, and Access uses simple checkboxes. These provenance options work together like the location ones do: if multiple are entered (i.e. Owner, Collector, and References), the sample must satisfy the values specified by each different option. </li>	
	<li> <i> Fields: </i> To open this search option, select <strong>Fields to Show</strong> from the set of tabs below "Search Options." </li>
