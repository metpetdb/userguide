<p> <strong>Note: To upload data to MetPetDB, you must have an account and be logged in at the time of uploading.</strong> If you don't have an account yet, see our guide above to get you started!</p>
<p> You can upload data to MetPetDB in two different ways. You can either upload a single sample at a time, or you can use bulk upload to add multiple samples or chemical analyses at once.</p>
<p> To upload a single sample, use the following steps: </p>
<ol>
	<li> Hover over <strong>Upload Data</strong> from the menu bar at the top of the site and select <strong>Sample</strong>. </li>
	<li> Here, fill in the appropriate boxes with your sample's information. </li>
	<li> You can enter as much data as you would like, as long as you have specified <i> Number </i>, <i> Rock Type </i>, <i> Latitude </i>, and <i> Longitude </i>. <strong> Note: Unless you change the Public setting to "Yes," your sample will automatically be set to private, and other users will not be able to see it. </strong> </li>
	<li> When you have finished entering your data, review it, and select <strong> Save Changes </strong> in order to upload your sample. </li>
</ol>
<p>To upload multiple samples at once, you will need to have your data prepared in a spreadsheet, using either .xls or .csv file extensions and following our data formats. (Appropriate sample) This spreadsheet must then be uploaded to Dropbox. Once uploaded to Dropbox, hover over your file then select <strong>Share</strong>, <strong>Create link</strong>, then <strong>Copy link</strong>. Your link should look something like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/a1b2c3d4/your_file_name.csv?dl=0. When you have the link ready, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
	<li> Prepare your data in a spreadsheet using our format. (See chemical analysis and sample templates here.) When it's complete, save it in either a .csv or a .xls format.</li>
	<li> Upload your spreadsheet to Dropbox, then hover over it and select <strong>Share</strong>, <strong>Create link</strong>, then <strong>Copy link</strong> </li>
	<li>Hover over <strong>Upload Data</strong> from the menu bar at the top of the site and select <strong>Bulk Upload</strong>. </li>
	<li> Select the type of data you'd like to upload (Samples, Chemical Analyses, or Images). </li>
	<li> Select <strong>Choose file</strong>, paste in your Dropbox link, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li> Now select <strong>Parse file for upload</strong>.</li>
	<li>If no problems were encountered during the upload of your data, you will be notified in green text at the top of the following page. In this case, congratulations! The data shown in the table has been added to the database and is ready for you to view. You're done! </li>
	<li>If problems were encountered in our upload process, you will be notified in red text at the top of the page, and you will see a table with at least one cell shaded red. The red cells are where we detected errors when trying to upload. If you hover over them, you'll see the type of error we encountered. </li>
	<li> Make the appropriate changes to the cells shaded in red, and review your table once more to be sure everything is correct. </li>
	<li> Select <strong>Submit</strong>, and we will attempt to add your data to the database again. Hopefully, everything will go smoothly this time, and your data will be ready for you to access in the database! </li>
